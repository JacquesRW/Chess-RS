ENGINE:
- Opening book
- Add checks to quiescence search - pseudo king move for all piece types then check
for checks from the corresponding piece
- Pawn structure - doubled, passed, connected, etc 
- Mobility (potentially huge performance hit?)

PERFORMANCE STUFF:
- Transposition tables - Zobrist hashing 
- refactor last_move to en passant square Option<Square>
- Board.kings field: (infrastructure mostly in place)
    deprecate get_king_square apart from when loading a Board
    update king squares on king moves only

MEMORY EFFICIENCY:
- get rid of board cloning in checking for checks - implement unmake move
- refactor Board.castling to a u8
