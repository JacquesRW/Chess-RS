ENGINE:
- Add checks to quiescence
- Optimise move ordering (currently sorting list before iterating through, potentially could be improved)

PERFORMANCE STUFF:
- refactor last_move to en passant square Option<Square>
- Board.kings field:
    deprecate get_king_square apart from when loading a Board
    update king squares on king moves only
