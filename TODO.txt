MINIMAX ALGORITHM:
    quiscience checks
    improve evaluation function

PERFORMANCE STUFF:

refactor last_move to en passant square Option<Square>

Board.kings field:
    deprecate get_king_square apart from when loading a Board
    update king squares on king moves only

COMPARISON: Old vs New
Python code evaluates <1000 paths per second (w/ a simpler eval function).
Current (release) rust code evaluates 50000-100000 paths per second, depending on the complexity of the position.
At minimum a 50x speed increase.
